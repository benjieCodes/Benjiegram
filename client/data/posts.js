      "Jesus‚Äô resurrection got me like.. ‚ÄúKeep your eyes on Jesus, who both began and finished this race we‚Äôre in. Study how he did it. Because he never lost sight of where he was headed‚Äîthat exhilarating finish in and with God‚Äîhe could put up with anything along the way: Cross, shame, whatever. And now he‚Äôs there, in the place of honor, right alongside God. When you find yourselves flagging in your faith, go over that story again, item by item, that long litany of hostility he plowed through. That will shoot adrenaline into your souls!‚Äù\nHebrews 12:2\n\nHe is RISEN. A very, very happy Easter, y‚Äôall!",

      "You are simply the best thing that has ever happened to me, @annasongsong. Celebrating this year of marriage in Ireland has reminded me how God's favor and blessings pour out on you when you learn to just receive all that He has for you. I am blessed beyond measure with a wife that constantly reminds me of His grace. You are my everything, and always will be. #1yearanniversary #ireland #skelligmichaelüç¥",
